Folder structure
1. uploads folder should be outside the src folder (security purpose, vulnerable for exploit, proceed with caution)
2. front end payloads should be outside the src folder as well




Code structure
1. follow psr 1 and 2 coding rules
https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-1/
https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-2/
2. create news feature
 - sanitize, validate and escape user inputs
 https://dev.to/anastasionico/good-practices-how-to-sanitize-validate-and-escape-in-php-3-methods-139b
 https://www.php.net/manual/en/security.database.sql-injection.php
 - should use prepared statements
 https://www.php.net/manual/en/pdo.prepared-statements.php#:~:text=Prepared%20statements%20offer%20two%20major,plan%20for%20executing%20the%20query.
3. database connection is defined both in index and create-news (better to have a single entry for easy maintenance)\
4. theres no exceptions defined or base error handling component. (better to plan out possible user or app errors that may occur)



Front end code structure
1. no form validation (article itself and upload)
2. backend code is mixed with the front end code (hard to maintain, follow mvc approach)



Recommendation
1. use mvc style approach
2. always validate and sanitize user inputs
3. paginate itemized dataset (performance impact)
4. better to have web api endpoints for articles. (reusability, security, automation, integration, extensibility benefits)
5. creating articles is open to all (maybe a limited identified people can add articles, implement login system for this feature)
